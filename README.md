# flask-gen CLI (still alpha version)

flask-gen CLI is a small tool for generating things to ease development in Python and flask. Currently it's limited to generating new modules.

## Supported commands

```
flask-gen generate module post
```

This command will create directory post with files `__init__.py` and `routes.py` in it.

# FAQ

## Why is it in JavaScript?

Because I come from front-end and am more familiar with node environment than Python's. You are welcome to start working your own CLI in Python, especially if you are experienced Python developer. I started doing seriously something in Python/Flask 6, six, months ago and I've been missing similar tool (Angular CLI spoilt me).
